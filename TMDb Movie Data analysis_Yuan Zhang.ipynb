    ">For this Data Analyst project, I selected the TMDb movie dataset from kaggle to investigate. According to kaggle introduction [page](https://www.kaggle.com/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata), the data contains information that are provided from The Movie Database (TMDb). It collects 5000+ movies and their rating and basic move information, including user ratings and revenue data.\n",

    "Accroding Kaggle data overview, the dataset provides some metrics that measure how successful these movies are. These metrics include popularity, revenue and vote average. It also contains some basic information corresponding to the movie like cast, director, keywords, runtime, genres, etc. Any of the basic information can be a key to a success movie. More specificly, these factors can be classified to two categrories as follows:\n",
    "#### Metrics  for Evaluating the Success Movie\n",

Besides, the dataset also contains the movie released year, so it also can let us to explore the trend in these movie metrics. Therefore, the qestions I am going to explore are including three parts:\n",

    "As the table shown above, we can find outliers in `popularity` data, but according to the [forum](https://www.themoviedb.org/talk/5141d424760ee34da71431b0), the popularity score is measured by number of favourites and number of watched list etc, since it has no upperbond, I decided to retain the original data. Also, there are a lot of **zero number** in `budget` and `revenue` data, so is `runtime`. Didn't these movies be released? Look at the data in `release_year column`, I find all movies in the dataset are released becauce **the minimum value is 1960 and there is no null value for it**. So I assume the zero values in the `budget` and `revenue` are missing data. But under the risk that these zero values may be just small values, I preceed to take a look for some zero data content to decide whether it is just a missing value or small value."

    "From the figure above, we can see that the trend of popularity mean is upward year to year, and the peak is in the 2015, while the trend of popularity median is slightly smoother in recent years. We still can conclude that on average, popularity over years is going up in recent years. The trend is reasonable due to the eaiser access of movie information nowadays. Moreover, in the Internet age, people can easily search and gether movie information, even watch the content through different sources. Maybe it is such the backgroud that boost the movie popularity metrics."

    "- **Director associated with high popularity movies**: `Steven Spielberg`. It's no doubt that he got the first place since he has won so many awards and honors for his high quality and popular work!\n",

    "   At part one, I explored some general questions. The result turned out that the movie popularity trend is growing from 1960 on average. Moreever, I focused on the movies which are with high revenue. I found movies with higher revenue level are with higher popularity in recent five years on average. Besides, movies with higher revenue level don't have the significant high score rating in recent five years. And this results made me want to learn more: What's properties that are associated with high popularity movies? What's properties that are associated with high voting score?\n",

And cast associated with high popularity movies are Robert De Niro and Bruce Willis; director associated with high popularity movies are Steven Spielberg; genres associated with high popularity movies are drama, comedy, and thriller but they also appeared in the most unpopular movies; keywords associated with high popularity movies are based on novel and dystopia; producer associated with high popularity movies are Warner Bros., Universal Pictures and Paramount Pictures, but they are also appeared in the most unpopular movies.\n",

    "## Limitation\n",
    "1. Data quality: althought I assume the zero values in revenue and budget column are missing, there are still a lot of unreasonable small/big value in the both of the columns. Also, the metrics about rating or popularity are not defined clearly, and the basis of them may be changing year by year.\n",
    "2. Although the the `popularity` doesn't have the upperbound , it actually have the high probability of having outliers. But I choose to retain the data to keep the data originalty. Maybe there are still the reason that I should take it into account.\n",
    "2. Units of revenue and budget column: I am not sure that the budgets and revenues all in US dollars? \n",
    "3. The inflation effect: I used the revenue and budget data to explore, but I didn't use the adjusted data, although it is provided the adjusted data based on the year 2010.\n",
    "4. In my reseach one, although I discussed the distribution of popularity in different revenue levels in recent five years, but I just cut the revenue levels based on it's quantile. I didn't find out the whole revenue distributin in the fisrt, so there may be exist risks that the high revenue level still cover a wide of range, and may affect the final result. Besides, in the part, I just discuss data in the recent five year, maybe in other year there are some different distribution.\n",
    "5. In research two, I dicussed the properties are associated with successful movies. The successful I defined here are high popularity and high voting score. But I didn't find the properties of high revenue since I just assume the high revenue level are with higher popularity, which is I found in research one, so it makes me just leave out the finding the properties of high revenue movie. But I think there must be some other factor that are associated with high revenue movies.\n",
    "6. In research two, I dicussed the budget level and runtime level properties, but I just cut both of them based on the whole time quantile data not year by year. Also, to cut them into four levels based on quantile still rough.\n",
    "7. The categorical data, when I analysed them, I just split them one by one, and count them one by one. But the thing is, there must be some effect when these words combine. For example, the keyword `based on novel` is popular, but what truly keyword that makes the movie sucess maybe the `based on novel`&`adventure`. \n",
    "8. I didn't count number of votes into consideration, so the rating score may be a bias whe the vote number is few."
